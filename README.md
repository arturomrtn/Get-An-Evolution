-Get an Evolution-

1. The game is clearly inspired by the 1996 Pokémon classic. The main difference from the previous game is the use of a Pokémon instead of a trainer to advance.

2. The main objective is to successfully reach the Pokémon Tower while controlling a Gastly. The Pokémon must avoid Cubone, the enemy at the Tower entrance, without causing any collisions.

3. Once Gastly gains access to the Tower, it will evolve into Haunter, thanks to the experience gained in the previous battle.

4. The second objective of the game after reaching the Tower is to defeat Marowak, thus enabling Haunter to reach its final evolution, Gengar. This marks the end of the game.
